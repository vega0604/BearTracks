## Inspiration
Navigating Sheridan College's campuses can be challenging. Even after three years of studying here, we still find ourselves searching various Sheridan websites or Google for directions. We realized that many places remain undiscovered simply because there’s no centralized way to find them. This led to the idea of BearTracks—an interactive map web app managed by students, designed to help students, faculty, and visitors to navigate the three campuses more efficiently.

## What It Does
BearTracks is a progressive web app that utilizes the **Mapbox API** to display campus landmarks in a 3D environment across Sheridan College campuses. Currently, we’ve mapped **Trafalgar, HMC, and Davis**, with plans to expand further with more landmarks, real-time data, and social features.

### Features:
- **Landmark Categories:** Users can filter and explore food spots, offices, study areas, parking, and more.
- **Landmark Details:** Displays hours of operation, important links, and other key info.
- **Interactive Navigation:** Users can freely explore the 3D map and plan their visits.
- **Quick Actions Search bar:** Users can search directly for landmarks and use commands like theme toggling.
- **AI Bruno Navigation Assistant:** Bruno the Bruin provides detailed directions and information.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React, Vite, ⌘K
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Mapping:** Mapbox, GeoJSON, SunCalc
- **Authentication:** Auth0
- **AI:** Gemini API
- **Deployment:** Vercel
- **Design:** Figma
- **Other Tools:** GitHub Actions, PWA
